# About Pyzo

Pyzo is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on
interactivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable for
scientific computing. Its practical design is aimed at simplicity and
efficiency.
It consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and uses
a set of pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways. Some
example tools are source structure, project manager, interactive help,
workspace ...
