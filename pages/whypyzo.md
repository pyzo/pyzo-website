# Why Pyzo


## Python and free software

Open source software is made by people who love writing code. Therefore
the quality can be comparable to that of commercial software (and
sometimes even better). The [Python programming language](http://www.python.org/about)
is the basis
for a large community thriving on open source software, and is used for
a broad range of tasks.

Python is designed to be easy to read, and might well be the easiest
programming language to learn. Nevertheless, it is really complete and
powerful, and by using extension code, the crucial parts of an algorithm
can be made as fast as C. Due to its open nature, Python is easy to
extend. In this manner, people have been able to introduce technologies
to Python such as USB interfacing, OpenGL, various GUI toolkits, and
GPU computing.


## The problem

The general public is in general reluctant to use open source software.
We think this is due to the following main reasons:

* **Fragmentation:** to do scientific programming one needs different packages
  from different websites. This fragmented approach can be confusing to
  “normal people”; people new to Python don’t know where to start.
* **IDE:** while coders often use old-school editors like VI or Emacs, normal
  people prefer a modern IDE (interactive development environment).
* **Support:** there is no official means of support for most open source
  software. (In general practice, open source developers are quite
  helpful, though.)
* **Documentation:** The documentation of open source
  software can be a bit sparse sometimes.


## The solution

* With Pyzo we will build a **coherent** scientific Python environment that
  is easy to use for normal people. The Pyzo distro will get you a
  basic setup suitable for scientific programming. But the
  installation is transparent, so additional packages can be installed
  in the conventional way.
* We have been working for several years on our *IDE*, and we’re getting
  very positive feedback.
* We engage on improving **standards and documentation** of our
  own packages as well as that of
  other projects. Further we will develop more tools to use the
  documentation from within the IDE in an effective way.
* We offer informal **support** through our mailing list.
  We think that we can be a good “middle person” between the
  normal user and the open source developers, by filing a bug report and
  helping the user to a temporal solution, or by simply solving the bug
  and sending a patch to the developer.
  There are plans for **paid support** as well.
