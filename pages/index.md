[Pyzo](http://pyzo.org) is a free and open-source computing environment based
on Python. If you're used to e.g. Matlab, Pyzo can be considered a
[free alternative](python_vs_matlab).
Pyzo is a Python IDE that works with any [Python](https://python.org) interpreter
installed on your system, including [Conda](https://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) environments.
The IDE is aimed at interactivity and simplicity, and consists of an
editor, a shell, and a set of tools to help the programmer in various
ways.

Get Pyzo going on your machine using the [quickstart](start), or
check the code on [Github](http://github.com/pyzo/pyzo).

The current version is 4.7.0 (released on 17-03-2019). [Get it](start) now.


## Testimonials

  It's performing beautifully, the UI is very intuitive and stylish (to
  my eyes anyway). It's about as efficient and powerful as WingIDE, but
  has significantly fewer UI surprises and crashes compared to WingIDE.
  It's UI is simpler and cleaner, while still getting it done.
  This is a very impressive app, on OSX close to alpha dog status (I've
  used ALL the OSX alternatives). *— Ken*
  
  I have configured 4 GUIs (PySide, Tk, PyQt4 and wxPython) for 2
  Pythons (2.7.5 and your 3.3.0) and all are working well. Unbelievable.
  *— Tovim*
 
  This is a great program for those of us on OSX. I do not know of another
  IDE that works this well. *— Jack*
  
  For quite a while now I've been looking for a way to switch from Matlab
  to Python. The last remaining problem was a lack of descent IDE for
  interactive work. I do a lot of short calculations, so a 'cell'
  execution mode is crucial for me. Thanks again for a great project! 
  *— Jev*
  
  This is fantastic IDE - exactly what I was looking for! *— Matt*
  
  I don't even remember how I found [Pyzo], so confused and desperate I was
  testing [all available IDE's] I could find. Installed it, and 10 minutes
  later I was coding, connecting with a glade created user interface, and
  everything is running so well. I ain't gonna change now. [Pyzo] is my
  choice. Thank you very much, and keep up this amazing work. *— Jose*
  
  Thank you for a great Python IDE. *— Stan*
  
  What I like especially of [Pyzo] is the plain and simple design of the
  UI (a Qt feature :)  while providing really powerful functionality.
  Please, keep this project running. *— Hans*
  
  This is EXACTLY the python IDE I have been waiting for, even though I
  didn't know it. Excellent job! *— Jaap*
