# Who can benefit from Python?

The goal of Pyzo is to make Python easier accessible for a large
audience. We distinguish three core user groups.
For all users Pyzo has the advantage that Pyzo and Python are free.
This means that students can use it at home. Hobbyist can fool around
without having to resort to an "illegal version". University groups can
safe money. And (tech) startups do not have to invest in expensive
software.


## Students and schools

The ease of use of Python as a programming language makes it very
suitable for children and people who are learning programming for the
first time. Python is fundamentally object oriented, and has many
language features that are also available in other languages. This makes
Python very suitable for teaching different aspects of programming.

With Pyzo we want to make Python easier accessible, and provide an
intuitive interactive development environment (IDE). Even a child should
be able to download and install Pyzo, and be able to start writing code
right away.


## Scientists and engineers

Openness in science is key. Scientists should be able to share
algorithms, and to verify the results of other scientist without having
to pay for a certain piece of software. Python is open. This openness
also makes Python easy to extend. Technologies such as GPU computing
and parallel processing are easily made available via Python.

The readability of Python, and its powerful approach for general tasks
make that scientists and engineers can focus on their algorithms. They
do not have to write complex code to do simple things; the algorithms
are often already complex enough. Its powerful introspection makes
debugging complex algorithms easier. Because Python is a dynamic
language, algorithms can be developed much quicker (rapid prototyping),
and large datasets do not have to be reloaded every time you make a
change to your algorithm.


## Companies

Because Python is designed as a general purpose language, commercial
applications are made with relative ease. Pyzo uses the
[Qt GUI toolkit](http://qt.io/), which makes it easy to build
professional applications with a wide range of powerful widgets.
Applications can be "frozen" (an executable can be made) and distributed
to clients. All packages in Pyzo have a liberal license that allows this.
Python is cross-platform, so it does not matter whether
your clients run Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

Pyzo is particularly useful for companies that make software that's
rooted in science. This is because Pyzo can be used as a development
tool as well as the tool to build the application for the client. This
means that it is not necessary to port the code to another language, a
process that's often hard and time consuming.
