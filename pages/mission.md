# Pyzo's mission

Our mission is to give people easy access to the tools and skills for
data-centric programming. We focus on the Python programming language,
an easy yet powerful language that is very suitable for a wide variety
of tasks; Python is great for learning, science and data analysis, as
well as application development. We are passionate about Python and we
want to give everyone the opportunity to use it.

Pyzo, Python, and most scientific Python packages, are BSD-licensed (and
therefore usable in commercial applications). We believe that scientific
software should be free, because:

* It helps scientist to make their results reproducible (because
  others wont have to buy software).
* We believe that students should be able to code in a proper
  environment at home too (without having to resort to an illegal
  version).
* Any researcher, no matter where he/she lives in the world, should
  have access to a powerful computing environment.

During our PhD (at the University of Twente in The Netherlands) we have
come to believe that Python has incredible potential for the use in
science and engineering. At the time (i.e. about 2010) there was still a
lot of work to do. Pyzo has been our effort to make data-centric
programing easier accessible.
